My simulator uses real-world proportions for planet sizes and orbital distances. However, to save time, I scaled down the orbital radii by approximately 30 times.
In the real world, the ratio between Earth's orbital radius and Earth's diameter is about 11,740. In this project, the ratio is set to 390.
